## Edge Case Coverage
| Case                  | Status  | Notes |
|-----------------------|---------|-------|
| Early assignment      | ⚠️ Partial | MSTY only |
| Insufficient buying power | ✅ Implemented | Basic case covered |
| Dividend date impacts | ✅ Implemented | 3 scenarios tested |

## Validation Gaps
1. **Yield Comparisons:** No implementation found
2. **Risk Metrics:** No calculation logic present
3. **Real-time P/L Tracking:** Not implemented

## Recommended Actions
1. Resolve TypeScript compilation errors in `portfolioSlice.ts`
2. Implement real-time P/L tracking
3. Add yield comparison metrics
4. Implement risk metric calculations (Delta, Theta, Vega)
## Dividend Scenario Tests (Added 6/16/2025)

### Test 1: Applies 1.5x dividend risk factor for ETFs within 5 days of ex-dividend date
- **Purpose**: Verify margin increases by 50% for ETFs near dividend dates
- **Setup**:
  - Mocked dividend data with ex-date 3 days away
  - Added TSLY stock position to portfolio
  - Created covered call strategy on TSLY
- **Execution**: Called executeETFTrade()
- **Assertion**: Margin requirement was 575 (50% of stock value) instead of 287.5 (25%)
- **Result**: ✅ Passed

### Test 2: Does not apply dividend risk factor for non-ETFs
- **Purpose**: Ensure non-ETFs don't get increased margin requirements
- **Setup**:
  - Mocked dividend data with ex-date 3 days away
  - Added AAPL stock position to portfolio
  - Created covered call strategy on AAPL
- **Execution**: Called executeETFTrade()
- **Assertion**: Margin requirement was 3625 (25% of stock value)
- **Result**: ✅ Passed

### Test 3: Uses normal margin when dividend fetch fails
- **Purpose**: Verify system falls back to normal margin when API fails
- **Setup**:
  - Mocked dividend API failure
  - Added TSLY stock position to portfolio
  - Created covered call strategy on TSLY
- **Execution**: Called executeETFTrade()
- **Assertion**: Margin requirement was 287.5 (25% of stock value)
- **Result**: ✅ Passed

### Key Findings
- Dividend risk factor correctly applied only to ETFs
- System gracefully handles API failures
- Margin calculations remain accurate in all scenarios

## Margin Utilization Warning Tests (Added 6/17/2025)

### Test 1: Covered Call Strategy Logs Red Warning at 80% Margin Utilization
- **Purpose**: Verify covered call strategy logs red warning when margin utilization reaches 80%
- **Setup**:
  - Mocked state with $4000 total buying power
  - Created covered call strategy on MSTY with margin requirement $3200
- **Execution**: Called executeCoveredCallStrategy()
- **Assertion**: console.warn called with message containing "80.00% (red)"
- **Result**: ✅ Passed

### Test 2: Put-Selling Strategy Logs Red Warning at 80% Margin Utilization
- **Purpose**: Verify put-selling strategy logs red warning when margin utilization reaches 80%
- **Setup**:
  - Mocked state with $4000 total buying power
  - Created put-selling strategy on PLTY with margin requirement $3200
- **Execution**: Called executePutSellingStrategy()
- **Assertion**: console.warn called with message containing "80.00% (red)"
- **Result**: ✅ Passed

### Test 3: Collar Strategy Logs Red Warning at 80% Margin Utilization
- **Purpose**: Verify collar strategy logs red warning when margin utilization reaches 80%
- **Setup**:
  - Mocked state with $4000 total buying power
  - Created collar strategy on TSLY with margin requirement $3200
- **Execution**: Called executeCollarStrategy()
- **Assertion**: console.warn called with message containing "80.00% (red)"
- **Result**: ✅ Passed

### Key Findings
- Margin utilization warnings correctly triggered at 80% threshold for all strategies
- Warning messages include strategy name and utilization percentage
131 | - Console warnings use appropriate color coding (red)
