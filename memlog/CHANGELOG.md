## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-15
### Fixed
- Resolved Windows build symlink privilege error by creating custom `fix-winCodeSign.js` script
- Added pre-build step to filter macOS files from winCodeSign package

## [Validation] - 2025-06-15

### Test Execution Summary
- **Test Suite**: Full integration test suite
- **Execution Command**: `npm test`
- **Result**: Partial failure
- **Coverage**: Incomplete (failing tests prevented full coverage assessment)

### Key Findings
- **Tests Executed**: 32
- **Passed**: 17 (53%)
- **Failed**: 15 (47%)
- **Critical Failures**: 
  - Service layer normalization logic (3 failures)
  - Component rendering and interaction (12 failures)

### Validation Outcome
❌ **DO NOT DEPLOY** - Critical failures in core functionality

See [ISSUES.md](./ISSUES.md) for detailed failure analysis. Test regressions indicate potential breaking changes in:
1. Data service normalization logic
2. Position management component rendering
3. Trade execution workflow

### Next Steps
1. Prioritize service layer fixes
2. Review component test implementations
3. Schedule retest after fixes

## [Fixed] - 2025-06-15
- Fixed failing test for tradeThunks error handling
- Updated test to match actual thunk behavior (fulfilled action with error payload)
- Added detailed debug logging to diagnose test failures
